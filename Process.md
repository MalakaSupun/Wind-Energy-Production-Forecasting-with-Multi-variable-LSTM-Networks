Overview
Wind turbines are a key source of renewable energy, but their power output depends on multiple variables, such as wind speed, temperature, and rotor speed. Predicting power output can improve efficiency, stability, and integration with the power grid.

This project leverages LSTM models to capture temporal patterns and relationships between variables to predict turbine power output with higher accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wind Turbine SCADA Dataset available on Kaggle. It contains measurements recorded every 20 minutes, including:

Wind Speed (m/s)
Wind Direction (°)
Ambient Temperature (°C)
Turbine Power Output (kW)
Preprocessing
Handled missing rows using KNN Imputation.
Reconstructed missing timestamps and scaled all features using Min-Max scaling.
Created sequences for LSTM training with a time window of 24 steps (8 hours).
Project Workflow
The project follows this structured workflow:

Data Preprocessing

Imputation of missing values using KNNImputer.
Scaling features using MinMaxScaler.
Sequence generation for LSTM input.
Feature Engineering

Added time-based features (e.g., hour of the day, day of the week).
Generated rolling statistics (e.g., moving averages).
Model Building

Built and trained an LSTM model with multiple layers:
128 units in the first layer
64 units in the second layer
32 units in the third layer
Added Dropout and Batch Normalization for better generalization.
Model Evaluation

Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate performance.
Visualized predictions against actual values.
Model Architecture
The LSTM model architecture is as follows:

Layer	Units	Activation
LSTM	128	ReLU
Dropout	-	-
LSTM	64	ReLU
Dropout	-	-
LSTM	32	ReLU
Dense	64	ReLU
Dropout	-	-
Dense (Output)	1	Linear
